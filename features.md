# Ignite Future Feature List

## News Feed for Connections (v1.1)

There should be a way to easily see what habits connections are completing, and what habits they still have left that day.

* **Feed**: There could be a feed of all connections habits for the last day. This could replace the network screen, or be built into it (larger cells with feed information).
* **Status Bar**: There could be a status bar at the top of the chat page (or built into the network page) of what habits a user still has left to complete.

## Achievements

Like Snapchat, just trophies that a user can gain. Any reason to get the user to use the app more frequently and be rewarded for doing so. Should be clean, slick, and unobtrusive. Just a simple screen of achievs and a nice animation when one is completed.

## Social Sharing and Increased Virality (v1.1)

The user needs to be able to easily invite their friends to the app and connect their habits with others.

* **Share via ...**: Sharing via text/social networks on settings page.
* **Notify New User**: Invite a new user when creating a new habit. This would be an "invite new" user cell at the end of the connections list on the creation page.
* **Finding Users**: The user should be able to find people they know who already have an account. This would occur through Facebook and the Contacts list. This would require accounts being linked to a Facebook, email, or phone number.

## Private Habits (v1.1)

This is important. Users need to be notified that their habits are public, and that when they accept or send a connection request, that user will be able to see all of their public habits. 

## Parse Security

I'm unsure how important this is. I'll look into it.

## Streaks and More Gamification on the Home Screen (v1.1)

Give the user more reasons on the home screen to use the app more frequently.

* **Streaks**: Give the user more reason to get something done daily. Same concept as "Momentum".
* **Badges**: Snapchat style badges seem to get me to respond to snaps more, similar conecpt... maybe have different style badges that you can gain and collect?
