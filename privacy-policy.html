<p>
Ignite requires information including but not limited to your name, a username of your choice, and in the future your email and telephone number. We use this information for the sole purposes of identifying you and your habits, as well as anonymously researching how people like to use the app. In addition, Ignite allows for the submission of user generated content such as messages and habit titles. Ignite will never share this information with any third parties on a personally identifiable basis, and keeping your privacy is paramount to all other concerns.

</p>
<p>
    USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION
</p>
<p>
    Ignite believes that the privacy of its users is paramount and will use their data only in ways outlined in this Privacy Policy. Most uses of data are

    ensure that its users’ data is safe and taken care of responsibly. Third parties will not be able to use information in ways that are prohibited by the
